Title: Functions supporting data analysis with R at KWB
Description: This package originally contained all the different helper 
    functions developed and used at KWB. As it grew, functions were extracted 
    into new packages that are dedicated to certain topics. The database access 
    functions, for example, that were originally contained here, are now in the
    package kwb.db. Functions that help to create event information from 
    time series data have been moved to kwb.event and date/time related 
    functions are now in kwb.datetime. This package still contains some 
    functions that are used in different scripts of different KWB projects.
    Currently, when loading this package, the packages kwb.datetime, kwb.db,
    kwb.event, kwb.plot and kwb.utils are automaticallc loaded. I plan to change 
    this behaviour with the next release so that you need to load the other
    packages explicitly, i.e. with library(kwb.datetime), library(kwb.db), etc.
