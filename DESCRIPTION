Description: This package originally contained all the
    different helper functions developed and used at KWB. As it grew,
    functions were extracted into new packages that are dedicated to
    certain topics. The database access functions, for example, that were
    originally contained here, are now in the package kwb.db. Functions
    that help to create event information from time series data have been
    moved to kwb.event and date/time related functions are now in
    kwb.datetime. This package still contains some functions that are used
    in different scripts of different KWB projects.  Currently, when
    loading this package, the packages kwb.datetime, kwb.db, kwb.event,
    kwb.plot and kwb.utils are automaticallc loaded. I plan to change this
    behaviour with the next release so that you need to load the other
    packages explicitly, i.e. with library(kwb.datetime), library(kwb.db),
    etc.
